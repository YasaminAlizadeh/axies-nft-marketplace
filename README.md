# Axies NFT Marketplace

This personal project showcases my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and Sass. It includes a landing page, login page, and single item page for an NFT marketplace. The platform features a slider to showcase items, dummy data to display more items, a custom loading spinner, and a carousel in the login page. Beautiful visual effects are used throughout the platform to enhance the user experience.

To use the platform, simply visit the landing page to view featured items. Click on an item to view the single item page, where users can learn more about the NFT and its creator. To access additional features, users can login. Additionally, the platform includes a light and dark theme for users to choose from, and is fully responsive to ensure a seamless experience across all devices.

Keep an eye out for the little details and fun touches throughout the platform - who knows what other surprises you might find! :)
